## Project Overview

Version strings follow the **MAJOR**(#?).**MODEL**(#??).**CONTROLLER**(#??).**VIEW**(#??)-**MILESTONE** format.  

So, Solar Eclipse (`v4`) is currently using Model `v3`, Controller `v1`, View `v1`, and is in its `alpha` milestone.

The project's packages and modules exist within the `dev.atomixsoft.solar_eclipse` namespace.  The only module is `core` - `server`, `editor`, and `client` sub-projects are comprised of a series of packages.

## Building

### Clean and Build All
To clean & build all sub-projects, execute the following:
```sh
./gradlew clean 
./gradlew build
```

### Clean and Build Core
You must build, preferably in a clean environment, the `core` sub-project before building `server`, `editor`, or `client`.

To clean & build only the `core` sub-project, execute the following:
```sh
./gradlew :core:clean 
./gradlew :core:build
```

### Clean and Build Server
To clean & build only the `server` sub-project, execute the following:
```sh
./gradlew :server:clean 
./gradlew :server:build
```

### Clean and Build Editor
To clean & build only the `editor` sub-project, execute the following:
```sh
./gradlew :editor:clean 
./gradlew :editor:build
```

### Clean and Build Client
To clean & build only the `client` sub-project, execute the following:
```sh
./gradlew :client:clean 
./gradlew :client:build
```


## Execution

### Running the Server

You must run the `server` sub-project before `editor` or `client`.

To run the `server`, execute the following:
```sh
./gradlew :server:run
```

To run `server` in debug mode, execute the following instead:
```sh
./gradlew :server:debug
```

### Running the Editor

To run the `editor`, execute the following:
```sh
./gradlew :editor:run
```

To run `editor` in debug mode, execute the following instead:
```sh
./gradlew :editor:debug
```

### Running the Client

To run the `client`, execute the following:
```sh
./gradlew :client:run
```

To run `client` in debug mode, execute the following instead:
```sh
./gradlew :client:debug
```
